# reCAPTCHA Android Demo
This project demonstrates the usage of reCAPTCHA Android library and how the captcha token is verified with the server. To use this project you will need a site key and a secret key. You can create one for your project here : `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#androidsignup`

This App uses Lottie Animation library (everyone loves animation right ?) which brings some fancy stuff to App :P<br />
More about Lottie for Android : `https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android`<br />
The animation files are downloaded from : `https://www.lottiefiles.com`

Lottie view has smooth Spring animation thanks to Rebound library by Facebook. Tap on Lottie view and it will animate on tap and release action (i.e. MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN and MotionEvent.ACTION_UP event). More about Rebound library : `http://facebook.github.io/rebound/`

To show any alert or message App uses Alerter which is quite cool, have a look here : `https://github.com/Tapadoo/Alerter`
